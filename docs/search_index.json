The Predictive Health Institute was established as part of the Emory University strategic plan in 2005 as an innovative approach to understanding and optimizing health that focuses on maintaining health rather than treating disease. The CHDWB was established as the clinical expression of Predictive Health, with the purpose of integrating PHI principles with scientific discovery, health focused research and education using a combination of established and cutting edge tools to identify and measure risks and deviations from health. The CHDWB serves as a practical test of the concept of health-focused care, as well as an academic resource and a clinical-translational laboratory with its innovative delivery model and longitudinal database and tissue repository. Two core CHDWB goals have been to describe health in social, cultural and biological terms, and to use these tools to understand and predict deviations from health and overall health prognosis. A variety of metrics are used in this process, including a battery of questionnaires, assessments and laboratory tests that are either disease specific (e.g. cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis) or follow common pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune status. The CHDWB established a prospective longitudinal cohort of approximately 750 individuals who were enrolled as early as 2006 and have undergone annual assessments as participation permitted and excepting attrition. Participants from the Emory University pool of employees were randomly offered to join the CHDWB cohort. Those who agreed to participate and who provided informed consent were predominantly heathy individuals. As the scientific arm of the Predictive Health Institute, two core CHDWB goals have been to describe health in social, cultural and biological terms, and to use these tools to understand and predict deviations from health and overall health prognosis. The CHDWB serves as a practical test of the concept of health-focused care, as well as an academic resource and a clinical-translational laboratory with its innovative delivery model and longitudinal database and tissue repository. A variety of metrics are used in this process, including a battery of questionnaires, assessments and laboratory tests that are either disease specific (e.g. cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis) or follow common pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune status. Examples of data elements collected from participants each year are personal and family health history, occupational history and exposures, tobacco and alcohol use, traditional medical and complementary medication use, detailed food intake, measures of stress, anxiety, depression, spirituality, validated metrics of physical functioning, social support, sleepiness and sleep quality. Participants also undergo traditional medical testing including treadmill testing, body composition and bone density testing, measures of cardiovascular function and risk, and traditional laboratory testing such as blood chemistry and hormone profiles. Innovative and cutting edge laboratory testing is also performed for regenerative cell potential, oxidative stress and inflammation, genetic and genomic analyses and large-scale metabolomics. 0.1 This Codebook The rest of this “book” provides the documentation, codebook definitions, descriptions of each questionnaire, instrument, clinical measurement and lab results.

["bdi.html", "Chapter 12 Beck Depression Index 12.1 Background", " Chapter 12 Beck Depression Index 12.1 Background The Beck Depression Index (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression (BECK 1961). The BDI-II was a 1996 revision of the BDI (Beck et al. 1996) developed in response to the American Psychiatric Association’s publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, which changed many of the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Items involving changes in body image, hypochondriasis, and difficulty working were replaced. Also, sleep loss and appetite loss items were revised to assess both increases and decreases in sleep and appetite. All but three of the items were reworded; only the items dealing with feelings of being punished, thoughts about suicide, and interest in sex remained the same. Finally, participants were asked to rate how they have been feeling for the past two weeks, as opposed to the past week as in the original BDI. Like the BDI, the BDI-II also contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original: 0–13: minimal depression 14–19: mild depression 20–28: moderate depression 29–63: severe depression. It should be noted that several papers have been written on the underlying dimensions of the BDI on whether the instrument captures two underlying constructs (somatic and cognitive) or three (somatic, cognitive and affective) (Corbi‘ere et al. 2011) More information on the Beck Depression Index (BDI) can also be found at the website of the American Psychological Association.

Their scores show how well their family communicated and lived together as a unit. A low score indicates better family functioning - higher is worse family functioning indicating higher stress levels in the family. Available online at http://www.nctsnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/pdfs/family_assessment_device.pdf The FAD is based on the McMaster Model of Family Functioning. The original scale has 60 items and measures 6 scales that assess the 6 dimensions of the MMFF - affective involvement, affective responsiveness, behavioral control, communication, problem solving, and roles - as well as a 7th scale measuring general family functioning. However, the version used here consisted of 27-items focusing on 3 scales: Problem Solving Communication General Family Functioning Each item is scored 1-4. Some items are reversed prior to summary. Final scores for each scale are the average across the items in their scale such that the final scores also range from 1-4. Clinical Cutoffs are: General family functioning: scores &gt; 2.00 are considered to indicate poor family functioning Communication and Problem Solving: scores &gt; 2.20 are considered to indicate poor communication or problem solving skills respectively. Additional information can be found at: (Akister and Stevenson-Hinde 1991) and (Bihum et al. 2002) and (Epstein, Baldwin, and Bishop 1983) and (Miller et al. 1985). 17.2 Items included The following 27 items were included for the FAD version used in this study: Planning family activities is difficult because we misunderstand each other. We resolve most everyday problems around the house. When someone is upset the others know why. In times of crisis we can turn to each other for support. We cannot talk to each other about the sadness we feel. We usually act on our decisions regarding problems. You can’t tell how a person is feeling from what they are saying. Individuals are accepted for what they are. People come right out and say things instead of hinting of them. We avoid discussing our fears and concerns. It is difficult to talk to each other about tender feelings. After our family tries to solve a problem, we usually discuss whether it worked or not. We can express feelings to each other. We talk to people directly rather than through go-betweens. There are lots of bad feelings in the family. We often don’t say what we mean. We feel accepted for what we are. We resolve most emotional upsets that come up. Making decisions is a problem for our family. We are frank with each other. We are able to make decisions about how to solve problems. We confront problems involving feelings. We don’t get along well together. We don’t talk to each other when we are angry. We confide in each other. When we don’t like what someone has done, we tell them. We try to think of different ways to solve problems. References "],

["epworth.html", "Chapter 19 The Epworth General Sleep Survey 19.1 Background", " Chapter 19 The Epworth General Sleep Survey 19.1 Background The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness that is measured by use of a very short questionnaire. This can be helpful in diagnosing sleep disorders. It was introduced in 1991 by Dr Murray Johns of Epworth Hospital in Melbourne, Australia (Johns MW (1991)). More information from the Epworth Sleepiness Scale website. Dr Johns first developed the ESS for adults in 1990 and subsequently modified it slightly in 1997. He developed it so he could assess the ‘daytime sleepiness’ of the patients in his own private practice of Sleep Medicine. He named the questionnaire after Epworth Hospital in Melbourne, where he established the Epworth Sleep Centre in 1988. The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most people engage in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person’s average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their ‘daytime sleepiness’. The questionnaire takes no more than 2 or 3 minutes to answer. It is available in many different languages. The 1997 version of the ESS is the standard version that can be used by most adults. A license is needed to use it, whether or not license fees are payable. "],

Normal range: 60-100 bpm Bradycardia: &lt;=60 bpm Tachycardia: &gt;=100 bpm 25.3 Body Composition - overview Body composition and bone density were measured. They measured the distribution of the participant’s body tissue (fat and muscle) and how strong their bones were. Using these data, BMI, waist-hip ratio, total percent body fat, lean tissue mass and total fat mass were then reported back to each participant. 25.4 Tanita Body Composition Analyzer BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis technique which is based on the fact that lean tissues have a high water and electrolyte content, and thus provide a good electrical pathway. Fat mass contains a lower percentage of body water, and thus is a poor conductor of the electrical signal. By inducing a low energy, high frequency, electrical signal (50kHz, 500 microamp), a measurement of the baseline resistance to the flow of electrical current can be made. This current is passed through the anterior electrode on the scale platform, and the voltage drop is then measured on the posterior electrode. The resistance measurement relates directly to the volume of the conductor which is used to determine total body water, lean body mass, and finally, fat mass. Percent body fat, as calculated by Tanita, is highly researched proprietary formula combining impedance and weight measurements with height, gender, and age information. It is looked upon a chart of percentages among age groups and gender. Measurements include: Weight- total body weight which includes muscle, bone, fat, water, etc. BMI- Correlates physical stature and body weight with mortality ratios like diabetes, cardio-pulmonary disease, cancer, etc. BMI is recognized as a valid assessment tool in identifying obese individuals. Body composition analysis may provide more information regarding actual changes in composition over an extended period of time. BMR- Basal metabolic rate measures the energy expended by the body to maintain normal body functions such as respiration and circulation. Impedance – measured in Ohms, the impedance value reflects how hard a mild electrical signal has to work to travel through the body. Lean mass (containing water and electrolytes) conducts the current, while fat mass acts as a resistor to the current. A standard range for impedance is 200-650. Do not compare impedance values among different people. Fat mass - Actual fat mass (in pounds, kilos, k or st. pounds) in the body. Fat Percent FFM (fat free mass)- Fat free mass (in pounds, kilos, or st. pounds) is comprised of muscle, bone, tissue, water, and all other fat free mass in the body. A healthy ratio for fat free mass to fat mass is approximately 5:1 for females, and 7:1 for males. Males carry more muscle than females therefore have a higher FFM. TBW (total body water) – (in pounds, kilos, or st. pounds) reflects the amount of water in the body. This monitors the hydration level. TBW/weight X 100= % hydration. According to dialysis standards, women should be approximately 50-60% hydrated, and males should be 60-70% hydrated.

the waist and hips were done with measuring tape. Once measured (in cm), the waist and hip circumferences are divided = waist/hip. Example for a man waist is 40” and a 38” (inches) hip would be (40/38) = 1.05 which may indicate that they are at a higher risk for disease. Each measurement was made 3 times and the average computed. The “umbilicus” was also measured which is the waist measurement at the “belly-button”. The NIH provided a protocol for the measurement of waist circumference for the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study. This protocol indicates that the waist measurement should be made at the level of the umbilicus or navel. However, published reports indicate that measurements of waist circumference made at the level of the umbilicus may underestimate the true waist circumference (CROFT et al. 1995). Some studies have assessed the waist circumference at the point of the minimal waist (Ross et al. 2008).

The reason being is that most men collect all of their fat in the abdomen and chest. Most women collect fat in the triceps and around the waist and thighs. Calipers are one of the few measurements to take because of cost and time. Type of Measurement: Measuring the body fat area then calculated the measurements a total of three attempts. The calculation answer will be the BMI which is then categorized along with your height and weight and age. This determines if you are under the underweight, normal, overweight, and obese category. Measurements range from 0-100 mm.

This test measures the participant’s ability to adjust to increasing levels of exercise. Unlike a doctor’s office stress test, we are not pushing people to a level of exercise that they are not comfortable with. Instead, a target heart rate is used that is based on established data for each person’s age and gender. Type of Measurement: Exercise level by using the participant’s target heart rate which is 220-age. Example 220-25 = 195. Measurements reported: Field Description Integer Digits Units Target Heart Rate positive 0-300 BPM Grade positive 0-30% percentage Miles Per Hour (mph) positive 0-6 MPH MET positive 0-24 whole number Modified Balke Protocol pick list (yes or no) a protocol a protocol Bruce Protocol pick list (yes or no) a protocol a protocol VO2 Max Estimate positive calculated equation volume of oxygen Heart Rate positive 0-200 BPM 25.9 Vivid 7 Ultrasound Caroid IMT Name of Equipment: GE Vivid 7 Ultrasound Description of Equipment: This is a measure of how thick the wall of the artery in the participant’s neck (carotid artery) is. That is one measure of the status of their blood vessels. In a group of very healthy people age 20-70 years, carotid IMT increased on average with age (see graph). However, some older people had low numbers. We think the low numbers are healthier and we will discover whether that is the case by studying a large number of people over time, including you. For example, the report could say “Your carotid IMT is 0.42 mm and the large star on the graph shows where you fit in the normal population.” Type of Measurement: Measures thickness of carotid artery. Normal Ranges/Interpretation: This result indicates that your carotid IMT thickness is less than the average for people your age, possibly indicating better than average vascular health. Measurements include: Field Description Integer Digits Units RCNW (mm) positive 0.001-1.0 mm RCRW (mm) positive 0.001-1.0 mm Right Mean Carotid IMT (mm) positive 0.001-1.0 mm LCNW (mm) positive 0.001-1.0 mm LCFW (mm) positive 0.001-1.0 mm Left Mean Carotid IMT (mm) positive 0.001-1.0 mm Plaque (yes or no) yes or no yes or no yes or no 25.10 SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Velocity Name of Equipment: SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Analysis, SCOR-PX Description of Equipment: This is a special measure of blood pressure that interprets the pulse wave generated by the beating heart to estimate the pressure in your aorta, the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart throughout the body. There is some evidence that this measure of blood pressure is a better predictor of how healthy your blood vessels are than blood pressure the usual way it is taken. Approximate Time to Complete: 15 minutes Type of Measurement: Average Pulse height, Pulse height variation, Diastolic variation, Shape deviation, and your central blood pressure. Normal Ranges/Interpretation: Average Pulse height - greater than 80, Pulse height variation- less than 5, Diastolic variation- less than 5, Shape deviation- less than 2. Measurements include: Field Description Integer Digits Units Central Systolic Pressure positive 0-300 mmHg Central Diastolic Pressure positive 0-300 mmHg Central Pulse Pressure positive 0-200 mm Hg Central Augment Index positive 0-100 percentage Augmentation Pressure positive 0-100 mmHg*ms 25.11 Itamar Endo-Pat2000 Name of Equipment: Itamar Endo-PAT2000 (EP), Itamar Medical Ltd. Description of Equipment: The Endo-PAT2000 device is a non-invasive, intended for use as a diagnostic aid in the detection of coronary artery Endothelial Dysfunction (positive or negative) using a reactive hyperemia procedure. Type of Measurement: Any kind of dysfunction in the Endothelial layer means some of some blockage in the body. This device aids in the detection of the overall functioning of the arteries in the heart. The results from the Endo-Pat have been shown to be predictive of early heart disease and artery dysfunction but is not intended to be diagnostic. Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) and Augmentation Index (AI) are reported. Normal Ranges/Interpretation for RHI: RHI &gt; 1.67-Normal, Above 1.67 means there is no Endothelial Dysfunction. RHI &lt; 1.67-Abnormal, Below 1.67 means there is Endothelial dysfunction. 25.12 Flow Mediated Dilation Ultrasound Data Fields: PARTICIPANT_FASTING OPERATOR NOTES INCOMPLETE HYPEREMIA_VTI HYPEREMIA_QRS3 HYPEREMIA_QRS2 HYPEREMIA_QRS1 HYPEREMIA_PEAKV HYPEREMIA_MEAN HYPEREMIA_HR FMD_PCT DATE_PERFORMED BASELINE_VTI BASELINE_QRS3 BASELINE_QRS2 BASELINE_QRS1 BASELINE_PEAKV BASELINE_MEAN BASELINE_HR AFTER_BLOOD_DRAW ABSOLUTE_CHANGE References "],

High blood glucose, which typically happens after eating a meal, stimulates the release of insulin, whereas low blood glucose levels inhibits insulin release. Insulin levels measured while fasting can give information about the body’s sensitivity to insulin. This is a test that measures the amount of insulin in your blood. Insulin Ideal range &lt; 16 uIU/mL Testosterone: Testosterone is a steroid hormone. It is produced primarily in the testes in males and in the ovaries in females. Alternative forms of testosterone are produced in the adrenal glands and may have similar effects to both sexes. Testosterone levels are important for normal growth and development, adult reproductive health, and contribute to a variety of physical features such as male-pattern hair growth. The range of normal testosterone levels depends on age and sex. The proportion of estradiol to testosterone is often an important health indicator. Testosterone Ideal Range: 250 - 1100 NG/DL Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH): TSH is measured as a screening test for thyroid function. This test measures the amount of TSH in the blood.

Platelets ideal range: 140 - 400 THOUS/MCL Critical: &lt;50 or &gt; 749 26.1.3 Inflammation Health C-Reactive Protein (CRP-high sensitivity): C-Reactive protein is a molecule whose quantity in blood rises with the degree of systemic or generalized inflammation in a person’s body. It does not indicate any specific infection or inflammatory process but is a marker for non-specific inflammation. Lower quantities are generally better. CRP ideal range: &lt; 0.79 mg/dL 26.1.4 Metabolic Health Albumin: Albumin is the protein of the highest concentration in the plasma and is made in the liver. The amount of albumin in the blood is a general indicator of nutritional health. This test measures the amount of albumin within the serum of blood. Albumin ideal range: 3.6 - 5.1 g/dL Alkaline Phosphatase: Alkaline phosphatase is a protein found in all body tissues. Tissues with particularly high amounts of ALP include the liver, bile ducts, and bone. This test measures the amount of ALP in your blood and provides information relevant to liver and bone health. Alkaline Phosphatase ideal range: 40 - 115 U/L Alanine Transaminase (ALT): This test measures the amount of the liver enzyme ALT in the blood. The measurement provides additional information about liver health. ALT ideal range: 9 - 60 U/L Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): AST is found in high concentration in heart muscle, liver cells, and skeletal muscle cells. This test provides additional information about liver health by measuring the amount of AST in the blood. AST ideal range: 10 - 35 U/L Bilirubin: Bilirubin is a product that results from the breakdown of hemoglobin. Its concentration in the blood is primarily an indicator of how well the liver and the gallbladder are functioning. Bilirubin Ideal range: .2 - 1.2 mg/dL Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): BUN is what forms when protein breaks down. A test can be done to measure the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood, which is a measure of kidney health. BUN Ideal range: 7 - 25 mg/dL Chloride: Chloride is a negatively charged molecule in the fluid outside the body’s cells. It works with other substances, including sodium, to help control the body’s fluid level and acid-base balance. This test measures the amount of chloride in the blood. Chloride Ideal range: 98 - 110 mmol/L Carbon Dioxide (CO2): CO2 levels in the blood are influenced by kidney and lung function. The kidneys are mainly responsible for maintaining the normal bicarbonate levels. This test provides information about your kidney and lung health by measuring the amount of carbon dioxide is in your blood, usually in the form of bicarbonate. CO2 Ideal range: 21 - 33 mmol/L Glucose: This test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood. The test may be used to diagnose or screen for diabetes and to monitor patients who have diabetes. Glucose Ideal range: 65 - 99 mg/dL Glucose Impaired fasting: &lt; 50 or 100 - 126 mg/dL Glucose Suspect diabetes: &gt; 126 mg/dL Potassium: Potassium helps nerves and muscles communicate. It also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells. This test measures the amount of potassium in the blood. Potassium Ideal range: 3.5 - 5.3 mmol/L Protein: This test is a rough measure of all the proteins found in the fluid portion of your blood. Specifically it looks at the total amount of two classes of proteins: albumin and globulin. This is a general measure of nutritional health. Protein Ideal range: 6.2 - 8.3 g/dL Sodium: This test measures the amount of sodium in the blood. The level of sodium in your blood is a balance between the sodium in the food and drinks you consume and the amount in urine excreted. Sodium Ideal range: 135 - 146 mmol/L Cholesterol: Cholesterol is a soft, wax-like substance found in all parts of the body. Your body needs a small amount of cholesterol to work properly. This test measures all the cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. Cholesterol Ideal range: 125 - 200 mg/dL Cholesterol Borderline low: &lt; 125 Cholesterol Borderline high: 200 - 239 Cholesterol High: &gt; 240 Triglyceride: Triglycerides are a type of fat that is either made by your body or comes from the food you eat. When you eat, your body uses calories for immediate energy. Leftover calories are turned into triglycerides and stored in fat cells for later use. This test measures the amount of triglycerides in your blood. Triglyceride Ideal range: &lt; 150 mg/dL High Density Lipoprotein (HDL): The main function of HDL is to help soak up excess cholesterol from the walls of blood vessels and carry it to the liver, where it breaks down and is removed from the body in the bile. Studies of both men and women have shown that the higher your HDL, the lower your risk of coronary heart disease, thus HDL is sometimes referred to as “good” cholesterol. HDL Ideal range: &gt; 39 mg/dL Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL): This test measures how much LDL you have in your blood. LDL is a type of cholesterol. Too much LDL in the blood can clog arteries. This test is usually done to determine your risk for heart disease. The LDL test is usually done as part of a lipid analysis, which also check for total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. LDL Ideal range: &lt; 130 MG/DL (CALC) LDL Borderline high: 130 - 159 LDL High: 160 - 189 LDL Very high: &gt; 190 26.1.5 Microvascular Health Urine Microalbumin/Creatinine Ratio: Creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, is normally excreted into the urine on a consistent basis. Its level in the urine is relatively stable. Since the concentration (or dilution) of urine varies throughout the day, this property of creatinine allows its measurement to be used as a corrective factor in random urine samples. When a creatinine measurement is performed along with a random microalbumin, the resulting microalbumin/creatinine ratio approaches the accuracy of the 24-hour microalbumin test without the extended collection hassle. Urine Microalbumin/Creatinine Ratio Ideal range: &lt; 30 mcg/mg creatinine Urine Microalbumin/Creatinine Ratio Microalbuminuria: 30 - 299 Urine Microalbumin/Creatinine Ratio Clinical Albuminuria: &gt; 300 26.1.6 Nutrition Screen 25-hydroxy Vitamin D : This test that measures the amount of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood. This test is the most accurate measure of the amount of vitamin D in the body. You can obtain vitamin D from supplements or by exposure to sunlight. VIT-D Ideal range: 30 - 100 ng/mL VIT-D Optimal: &gt;=30 ng/mL VIT-D Insufficiency: 20 - 30 ng/mL VIT-D Deficiency: &lt;20 ng/mL Vitamin B-12: This test that measures the amount of Vitamin B-12 in your blood. A Vitamin B-12 level can tell us information about your nutritional health. VIT B-12 Ideal range: 200 - 1100 PG/ML Ferritin: The amount of ferritin in your blood (serum ferritin level) is directly related to the amount of iron stored in your body. Iron is important for producing red blood cells. Ferritin Ideal range: 20 - 380 NG/ML Serum Iron: This is another test that measures how much iron is in your blood. Serum Iron Ideal range: 45 - 170 mcg/dL 26.1.7 Laboratory General - Data Fields: LG URINECREAT LG MICROALBUMIN LG ALBUM CREAT RATIO LG TOTCHOLESTEROL LG HDL LG TRIGLYCERIDES LG LDL LG CHOL HDLC RATIO LG NON HDL CHOL LG GLUCOSE LG BUN LG CREATININE LG EGFR NAM LG EGFR LG BUN CREAT RATIO LG SODIUM LG POTASSIUM LG CHLORIDE LG CO2 LG CALCIUM LG PROTEIN LG ALBUMIN LG GLOBULIN LG ALB GLOB RATIO LG BILIRUBIN LG ALKPHOSPHATASE LG AST LG ALT LG D25TOTAL LG D25D2 LG D25D3 LG TSH LG WHITEBLOODCELL LG REDBLOODCELL LG HEMOGLOBIN LG HEMATOCRIT LG MCV LG MCH LG MCHC LG RDW LG PLATELET LG ABS NEUTHROPHILS LG ABS LYMPHOCYTES LG ABS MONOCYTES LG ABS EOSINOPHILS LG ABS BASOPHILS LG NEUTHROPHIS LG LYMPHOCYTES LG MONOCYTES LG EOSINOPHILS LG BASOPHILS LG TOT IRON CAPACITY LG IRON CAPACITY LG SATURATION LG FERRITIN LG B12 LG C CREATIVE LG INSULIN LG ESTRADIOL LG TESTOSTERONE LG FREE TESTOSTERONE LG TESTOSTERONE BIOAVAIL LG SHBG LG ALBUMIN SERUM 26.2 Laboratory Research The following research laboratory measurements were performed: HPLC redox MMP-9 4-Plex Data T-cell Data CD34 26.2.1 Introduction to Research Biomarkers (from the Health Action Report) Research biomarkers are a group of tests that measure four processes that we believe will provide new definitions of what health is and give clues to new things that can be done to maintain health. These four processes (oxidative stress, inflammation status, regenerative potential and immune health) are believed to be “generic” markers of health. They will detect very early changes long before any disease occurs, but they are not specific to any one disease. When these processes go awry, the end result might be cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, or cancer. If we are right, these measurements will become critical to health focused care. Your participation in the Center’s activities is helping in a very real way to develop research information to determine their usefulness. We believe that measurements of inflammation, immune function, oxidative stress and regenerative potential will be better predictors of health than the things we are now using. We have some information to support that idea. In this section, we will summarize measurements of those processes in you and tell you what we know (and don’t know) about what these measurements mean at this point. As we discover further meaning of these tests, we will share that information with you. 26.2.2 Research Biomarkers Oxidative Status (redox): All of our cells use oxygen for energy. Over time, some cellular processes can start to work improperly causing a condition called oxidative stress. This means that the cells are not fully converting oxygen to energy in the manner that they would in a completely healthy condition. Similar to a misfiring car engine, the fuel may not be used efficiently and harmful waste products can occur. The inefficient use of oxygen is measured in terms of being oxidized or reduced. Cys Redox result given in mV Typical range for healthy adults is -98 to -62 mV GSH Redox results given in mV Typical range for healthy adults is -155 to -121 mV Inflammation Status: The immune system is important in providing protection against infections and plays a critical role in regulating healing responses. When called into action, immune cells cause inflammation through which they wall off and destroy infections and other abnormal conditions. If not regulated tightly, such inflammatory responses can turn against healthy tissues and cause a vast spectrum of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. The immune system is composed of trillions of cells which can be easily accessed in a blood sample and analyzed in sophisticated assay systems. The composition of the immune system changes over time, influenced by infectious experiences and exposure to environmental challenges. A major factor in shaping the immune system is age, as the ability to rebuild and maintain immune cells changes over life time. A careful analysis of the immune system can therefore provide insights into life stresses and biologic effects of the aging process and can reveal subtle changes long before individuals actually get sick. TNF-a usually analyzed and displayed as log(TNF-a) Regenerative Potential: We each have the capacity to heal our organs and tissues from innate systems of repair. A key component of the innate repair system is the circulating precursor or stem cells that can be found circulating in the blood. These precursor cells can be isolated from your blood specimen and tested for activity. In general, a vigorous response to an injury or abnormal situation indicates a positive tendency toward being able to self-repair damages in tissues and organs.
